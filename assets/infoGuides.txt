----- Corners Buffers: -----
How close to the corner should the mouse get
before corner action occurs. Setting this to
`"0`" means the mouse has to hit the pixel
perfectly on the nose. That's typially okay,
but not when you're remoted into your system
from another.

-----------------------------

Rest Time:
How long should the program wait before performing
another action. Setting this higher allows for
avoiding accidentl double taps, but setting
too low can make you question your existance.

-----------------------------

Identifier Timer:
How long to keep the on-screen display
identifers, uhh... on the screen. Setting this
to `"0`" will keep them open until this configuration
tool closes.

-----------------------------

Open the Config Tool on Start
Keeping this checked will show this configuration
tool everytime the program is launched. Uncheck
it to only show the configuration tool when you
call it from the SysTray.

-----------------------------

----- Portable Configuraiton -----
This option does not display when the program is
running from a location where the user running the
program doesn't have Write access. If permissions
are allowed this option attempts to place the
configuration files in the same location as the
base program. There's no guarantee this will work
between systems, though.... It's more for a
backup / historical purposes.

The Powershell Command feature is this command:
	Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden -FilePath "powershell.exe" -ArgumentList "-command ```"`$cmd```""
Where `$cmd = "Whatever-You-Have-Placed-There"

So, for example:
To start the system's currently selected screensaver:
	& (Get-ItemProperty 'HKCU:Control Panel\Desktop').{SCRNSAVE.EXE}

-----------------------------

Where's the option to start this when my computer
starts?
It doesn't exist. This program is a PowerShell file, not
an EXE file, because I don't know how to digitally
sign an EXE file to stop virus scanners. Instead the
solution is to make a task in Window's Task
Scheduler.

Triggers Tab:
	Begin the task: At log on

Action tab:
	Program/script: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
	Add arguments: /c START /min `"`" powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File `"C:\Path\to\HKT Folder\hawtKoners.ps1`"
